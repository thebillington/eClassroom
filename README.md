Repository to hold eClassroom dissertation code

##Goals
My disertation is a research project based around education, looking into the quality of resources and tools available to students on the new Computer Science curriculum in the UK. This code repository holds code for a Jetty website, which is being built as a portal with an emphasis on the teacking of student progress, and the graphical display of this information.

##Running the code
To run the project at it's given state, download the project to your computer and load into eclipse, or another IDE. Run the main JettyServer.java file to start the server on port 8080, then navigate to localhost:8080 in your web browser. There is currently no persistent data stored by the server, so all user accounts are deleted on stopping of the server.
